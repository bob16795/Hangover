## What is Hangover?

In short, it is a 2D game engine written in Nim. Hangover started as a full rewrite of a game engine called gin, which was inspired by Monogame. At the point of writing this, Hangover has been inspired by Unity, GodotNim and more.

## Why Use Hangover?

There are little to no reasons to use hangover as it was just made as a side project, but these are the reasons I use it.

### Optional EC code

Hangover supports a ec system based off unitys. Allowing an "easier" transition from unity to Hangover.

### Clean(ish) Code

Hangover uses nims macros to define systems, allowing for cleaner code.
